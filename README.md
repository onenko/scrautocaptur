# scrautocaptur
SCReen AUTOmatic CAPTURe application. Simple and straitforward

## Intro
Screen capturing in very old and widely investigated topic.
There are tons of utilities to do it.
Usually authors boast the possibities to control million things during the capture and saving the result,
like selecting some rectangular or any form regions of the screen to capture, etc.

What I need is to visit some meeting and/or presentation, and devote all my attention to
the topic without worrying about screen capture. I just want full screen captured automatically
and saved to ANY file name automatically.

## ScrAutoCaptur

Java based utility.

At some moment just start it

java -jar ScrAutoCaptur.jar 6

and forget during a skype or other conference.
Every 6 seconds your screen is captured and saved to some C:\TEMP\ScrAutoCaptur\YYMMDD\hhmmsstt.png file.

After that, just Ctrl-C it and go to see your screenshots, select needed and remove unnnessesary.
